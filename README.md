# ARC Prize 2025 – Abstract Reasoning Challenge

This repository contains my code, experiments, and research notes for the [ARC Prize 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025) competition on Kaggle.

## 📘 Project Goals
The ARC Prize aims to measure **general reasoning** and **abstract thinking** in AI systems.  
This repo documents my journey to build a solver that can generalize across unseen reasoning tasks.
