# ARC Prize 2025 – Abstract Reasoning Challenge

This repository contains my code, experiments, and research notes for the [ARC Prize 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025) competition on Kaggle.

## 📘 Project Goals
The ARC Prize aims to measure **general reasoning** and **abstract thinking** in AI systems.  
This repo documents my journey to build a solver that can generalize across unseen reasoning tasks.

## 📁 Repository Structure
data/ # Local datasets (excluded from GitHub)
notebooks/ # Jupyter/Kaggle notebooks
src/ # Python source code (models, utils)
experiments/ # Logs, configs, and results

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Understand dataset format and manually solve sample tasks
- [ ] Implement baseline rule-based model
- [ ] Design modular "transform primitives"
- [ ] Experiment with neural-symbolic hybrid approaches
- [ ] Optimize for efficiency and generalization

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- NumPy, Pandas
- PyTorch (optional)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
